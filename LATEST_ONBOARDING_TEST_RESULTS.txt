❌ Failed Endpoints:

CURRENT ISSUE
=============
The Apache configuration still needs the proxy rules for:
1. `/onboarding` - for all onboarding endpoints
2. `/vlookup` - for ONDC lookup functionality

REQUIRED APACHE CONFIGURATION
=============================
Add these proxy rules to your Apache configuration file:

```apache
# Onboarding endpoints - ADDED FOR ONDC SUBSCRIBE
ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding

# Lookup endpoints - ADDED FOR ONDC LOOKUP
ProxyPass /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
ProxyPassReverse /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
```

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
=========================
1. Find your Apache configuration file:
   sudo grep -r "neo-server.rozana.in" /etc/apache2/sites-available/

2. Add the missing proxy rules to that file:
   sudo tee -a /etc/apache2/sites-available/YOUR_FILENAME > /dev/null << 'EOF'

    # Onboarding endpoints - ADDED FOR ONDC SUBSCRIBE
    ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
    ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
    
    # Lookup endpoints - ADDED FOR ONDC LOOKUP
    ProxyPass /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
    ProxyPassReverse /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
EOF

3. Test and reload Apache:
   sudo apache2ctl configtest && sudo systemctl reload apache2

CURRENT STATUS
==============
Working Endpoints: 15/17 (88%)
Failed Endpoints: 2/17 (12%) - /vlookup and all /onboarding/*

The application is very close to being fully functional!
Only need to fix Apache proxy configuration for /vlookup and /onboarding endpoints.
