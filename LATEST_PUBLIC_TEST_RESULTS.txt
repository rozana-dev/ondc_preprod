7. STATUS ANALYSIS
==================
✅ STABLE: Health endpoints continue to work perfectly
✅ STABLE: ONDC callback endpoints continue to work perfectly
✅ STABLE: Basic lookup endpoint continues to work

❌ UNCHANGED: Onboarding endpoints still need Apache proxy rules
❌ UNCHANGED: Core action endpoints still need Apache proxy rules
❌ UNCHANGED: /vlookup endpoint still needs Apache proxy rule

8. APACHE CONFIGURATION NEEDED
==============================
The following proxy rules are still missing from Apache configuration:

# Lookup endpoints
ProxyPass /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
ProxyPassReverse /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup

# Onboarding endpoints
ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding

# Core action endpoints
ProxyPass /search http://localhost:8000/search

ProxyPass /select http://localhost:8000/select
ProxyPassReverse /select http://localhost:8000/select
ProxyPass /init http://localhost:8000/init
ProxyPassReverse /init http://localhost:8000/init
ProxyPass /confirm http://localhost:8000/confirm
ProxyPassReverse /confirm http://localhost:8000/confirm
ProxyPass /status http://localhost:8000/status

9. CURRENT STATUS
=================
Status: STABLE - No changes from previous test

The application is stable and the core ONDC functionality is working.
Additional endpoints need Apache proxy configuration to be accessible.
