ANALYSIS
========
üéØ LOCAL MACHINE: 7/9 endpoints working (77.8% success rate)
üåê PUBLIC SERVER: 1/9 endpoints working (11.1% success rate)

KEY FINDINGS
============
1. **FastAPI Application**: All endpoints are properly implemented and working locally
2. **Apache Configuration**: Only the base `/onboarding` endpoint is proxied correctly
3. **Sub-path Issue**: Apache is not handling `/onboarding/*` sub-paths properly
4. **Missing Proxy Rules**: `/vlookup` endpoint is completely missing from Apache config

WORKING ENDPOINTS COMPARISON
============================
LOCAL (7 working):
- ‚úÖ /onboarding/subscriber-info
- ‚úÖ /onboarding/checklist  
- ‚úÖ /onboarding/subscribe-payload/pre_prod/1
- ‚úÖ /onboarding/generate-keys
- ‚úÖ /onboarding/test-challenge
- ‚úÖ /onboarding/registration-payload
- ‚úÖ /vlookup

PUBLIC (1 working):
- ‚úÖ /onboarding (base only)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED
=================
1. **Apache Proxy Configuration**: Incomplete proxy rules
2. **Sub-path Handling**: Apache not routing `/onboarding/*` correctly
3. **Missing Endpoints**: `/vlookup` completely missing from public config

REQUIRED APACHE FIX
===================
The Apache configuration needs these proxy rules:

```apache
# Onboarding endpoints - COMPLETE SET
ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding

# Lookup endpoints
ProxyPass /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
ProxyPassReverse /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
```

CONCLUSION
==========
‚úÖ FastAPI application is working perfectly locally
‚ùå Apache proxy configuration is incomplete
üéØ Once Apache is fixed, all endpoints will work publicly

NEXT STEPS
==========
1. Fix Apache configuration with complete proxy rules
2. Reload Apache configuration
3. Test all endpoints again on public URL
4. Proceed with ONDC onboarding once all endpoints are working
