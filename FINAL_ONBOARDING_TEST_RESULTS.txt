ANALYSIS
========
üéâ PROGRESS MADE!
- The base `/onboarding` endpoint is now working! (returns {"status":"ok"})
- This indicates that the Apache proxy rule for `/onboarding` has been added
- However, the sub-paths are still not working

ISSUE IDENTIFIED
================
The Apache configuration has the proxy rule for `/onboarding` but it's not properly handling sub-paths like:
- `/onboarding/subscriber-info`
- `/onboarding/checklist`
- `/onboarding/subscribe-payload/pre_prod/1`
- etc.

This suggests the proxy rule might be:
1. Not configured to handle sub-paths correctly
2. Missing the proper ProxyPassReverse rule
3. Not reloaded properly

REQUIRED FIX
============
The Apache configuration needs to be updated to properly handle all `/onboarding/*` sub-paths:

```apache
# Onboarding endpoints - COMPLETE SET
ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding

# Lookup endpoints
ProxyPass /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
ProxyPassReverse /vlookup http://localhost:8000/vlookup
```

CURRENT STATUS
==============
‚úÖ Base /onboarding endpoint: WORKING
‚ùå /onboarding/* sub-paths: NOT WORKING
‚ùå /vlookup endpoint: NOT WORKING

PROGRESS: The Apache configuration is partially working!
Next step: Ensure the proxy rules are properly configured for sub-paths.
