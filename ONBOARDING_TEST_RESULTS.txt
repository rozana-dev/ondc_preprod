Response: Complete subscriber information with fresh keys

2. GET /onboarding/subscribe-payload/pre_prod/1

ANALYSIS
========
✅ FastAPI Application: Working perfectly on localhost:8000
✅ Onboarding Endpoints: All working locally
✅ Key Generation: Working with fresh keys
✅ Payload Generation: Working with correct format

❌ Apache Proxy Configuration: Missing or incorrect
❌ Public Access: All /onboarding/* endpoints returning 404

ROOT CAUSE
==========
The Apache configuration is missing the proxy rules for /onboarding endpoints.
The FastAPI application is working correctly, but Apache is not routing requests to it.

REQUIRED FIX
============
Add these proxy rules to your Apache configuration file:

```apache
# Onboarding endpoints - ADDED FOR ONDC SUBSCRIBE
ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
```

IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED
=======================
1. Find your Apache configuration file:
   sudo grep -r "neo-server.rozana.in" /etc/apache2/sites-available/

2. Add the proxy rules to that file:
   sudo tee -a /etc/apache2/sites-available/YOUR_FILENAME > /dev/null << 'EOF'

    # Onboarding endpoints - ADDED FOR ONDC SUBSCRIBE
    ProxyPass /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
    ProxyPassReverse /onboarding http://localhost:8000/onboarding
EOF

3. Test and reload Apache:
   sudo apache2ctl configtest && sudo systemctl reload apache2

CURRENT STATUS
==============
Local Application: ✅ Working perfectly
Public Endpoints: ❌ Need Apache configuration fix
ONDC Callback: ✅ Working (/on_subscribe)
Site Verification: ✅ Working (/ondc-site-verification.html)

The onboarding functionality is ready and working locally.
Only the Apache proxy configuration needs to be fixed.
